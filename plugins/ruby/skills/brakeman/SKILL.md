# Brakeman Security Scanner

## Overview

Brakeman is a static analysis tool that checks Ruby on Rails applications for security vulnerabilities without requiring a running application. It analyzes source code to detect common security issues including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, mass assignment, and many other vulnerability types.

## Installation

Verify Brakeman is installed before running scans. If not present, install using one of these methods:

```bash
# Using RubyGems (recommended)
gem install brakeman

# Using Bundler (add to Gemfile)
group :development do
  gem 'brakeman', require: false
end

# Using Docker
docker pull presidentbeef/brakeman
```

Brakeman requires Ruby 3.0.0+ to run, but can analyze code written with Ruby 2.0+ syntax. It works with Rails 2.3.x through 8.x.

## Basic Usage

### Quick Scan

Run a basic security scan from the Rails application root:

```bash
brakeman
```

From outside the Rails root:

```bash
brakeman /path/to/rails/application
```

### Output Formats

Generate reports in various formats:

```bash
# HTML report
brakeman -o report.html

# JSON report (useful for comparison and automation)
brakeman -o report.json

# Multiple output formats simultaneously
brakeman -o report.html -o report.json

# Output to console with color and file
brakeman --color -o /dev/stdout -o report.json

# Quiet mode (suppress informational messages)
brakeman -q
```

Available output formats: `text`, `html`, `tabs`, `json`, `junit`, `markdown`, `csv`, `codeclimate`, `sonar`

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
Is Brakeman already installed?
├─ No → Install using gem, bundler, or docker
└─ Yes → Continue

What is the goal?
├─ Initial security assessment → Run basic scan: `brakeman`
├─ Generate report for review → Choose format: `brakeman -o report.html`
├─ CI/CD integration → Use JSON output: `brakeman -o report.json`
├─ Too many warnings → Adjust confidence level or filter checks
├─ False positives → Use interactive ignore tool: `brakeman -I`
├─ Compare with previous scan → Use --compare flag
└─ Configuration needed → Create config/brakeman.yml
```

## Confidence Levels

Brakeman assigns confidence levels to each warning:

- **High**: Simple warning or user input very likely being used unsafely
- **Medium**: Unsafe use of variable that may or may not be user input
- **Weak**: User input indirectly used in potentially unsafe manner

Filter warnings by confidence level:

```bash
# Only high confidence warnings
brakeman -w3

# High and medium confidence warnings
brakeman -w2

# All warnings (default)
brakeman -w1
```

## Managing Warnings

### Filtering Checks

Run only specific checks:

```bash
# Run only SQL and XSS checks
brakeman -t SQL,CrossSiteScripting

# Skip specific checks
brakeman -x DefaultRoutes,Redirect

# Skip multiple checks
brakeman -x DefaultRoutes,Redirect,SQL
```

Use `brakeman --checks` to list all available check names (case-sensitive).

### Interactive Ignore Configuration

Manage false positives interactively:

```bash
brakeman -I
```

This launches an interactive tool that:
1. Presents each warning with context
2. Allows you to ignore, skip, or add notes
3. Saves configuration to `config/brakeman.ignore`

Options during interactive review:
- `i` - Add warning to ignore list
- `n` - Add warning to ignore list with note (recommended)
- `s` - Skip this warning
- `u` - Remove from ignore list
- `a` - Ignore remaining warnings
- `k` - Skip remaining warnings
- `q` - Quit without saving

Always add notes when ignoring warnings to document why they're false positives.

### Show Ignored Warnings

Temporarily view ignored warnings without affecting exit code:

```bash
brakeman --show-ignored
```

## Comparing Scans

Track security improvements or regressions by comparing scans:

```bash
# Generate baseline report
brakeman -o baseline.json

# Run new scan and compare
brakeman --compare baseline.json
```

Output shows:
- Fixed warnings (resolved since baseline)
- New warnings (introduced since baseline)

## Configuration

### Configuration Files

Store Brakeman options in YAML configuration files. Default locations (checked in order):
1. `./config/brakeman.yml`
2. `~/.brakeman/config.yml`
3. `/etc/brakeman/config.yml`

Specify a custom configuration file:

```bash
brakeman -c custom_config.yml
```

### Generate Configuration

Output current options to create a configuration file:

```bash
brakeman -C --skip-files plugins/ > config/brakeman.yml
```

Command-line options override configuration file settings.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
---
:skip_files:
  - vendor/
  - lib/legacy/
:confidence_level: 2
:output_files:
  - reports/brakeman.html
  - reports/brakeman.json
:quiet: true
```

## Performance Optimization

Speed up scans with faster mode (skips some features):

```bash
brakeman --faster
```

Equivalent to: `--skip-libs --no-branching`

**Warning**: May miss some vulnerabilities. Use only when scan speed is critical.

Skip problematic files or directories:

```bash
brakeman --skip-files file1.rb,vendor/,legacy/
```

## Advanced Options

### Safe Methods

Mark custom sanitizing methods as safe to reduce false positives:

```bash
brakeman --safe-methods sanitize_input,clean_html
```

### Exit Codes

Control exit code behavior:

```bash
# Don't exit with error on warnings
brakeman --no-exit-on-warn

# Don't exit with error on scanning errors
brakeman --no-exit-on-error

# Both
brakeman --no-exit-on-warn --no-exit-on-error
```

Default behavior: Non-zero exit code if warnings found or errors encountered.

### Debugging

Enable verbose debugging output:

```bash
brakeman -d
```

For comprehensive option reference including less common flags and detailed explanations, see `references/command_options.md`.

## Best Practices

1. **Run regularly**: Integrate into development workflow and CI/CD pipeline
2. **Start with high confidence**: Use `-w3` initially to focus on critical issues
3. **Document ignored warnings**: Always add notes explaining why warnings are ignored
4. **Compare scans**: Use `--compare` to track security posture over time
5. **Review all warnings**: Even weak warnings can indicate real vulnerabilities
6. **Keep Brakeman updated**: Security checks improve with each release
7. **Don't ignore blindly**: Investigate each warning before marking as false positive
8. **Use configuration files**: Maintain consistent scan settings across team
9. **Generate multiple formats**: HTML for review, JSON for automation
10. **Test ignored warnings periodically**: Re-review with `--show-ignored`

## Common Workflows

### Initial Security Audit

```bash
# 1. Run comprehensive scan
brakeman -o initial-audit.html -o initial-audit.json

# 2. Review high confidence warnings first
brakeman -w3 -o high-confidence.html

# 3. Interactively manage false positives
brakeman -I

# 4. Save configuration for future scans
brakeman -C > config/brakeman.yml
```

### CI/CD Security Gate

```bash
# Fail build only on high confidence warnings
brakeman -w3 --no-exit-on-error
```

### Tracking Improvements

```bash
# Baseline scan
brakeman -o baseline.json

# After fixes, compare
brakeman --compare baseline.json -o improvements.json
```

### Reducing Noise

```bash
# Focus on specific vulnerability types
brakeman -t SQL,CrossSiteScripting,CommandInjection -w2

# Or exclude noisy checks
brakeman -x DefaultRoutes,Redirect -w2
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Too many weak confidence warnings
**Solution**: Use `-w2` or `-w3` to filter by confidence level

**Problem**: Scanning is very slow
**Solution**: Use `--faster` flag or `--skip-files` to exclude large directories

**Problem**: False positives for custom sanitization
**Solution**: Use `--safe-methods` to mark methods as safe

**Problem**: Warnings about database values
**Solution**: Consider if database values truly safe; if yes, adjust with `--interprocedural` or configuration

**Problem**: Can't parse certain files
**Solution**: Use `--skip-files` to exclude problematic files
